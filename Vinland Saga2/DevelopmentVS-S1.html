        <h2>Thors — The Quiet Cause</h2>
        <p>
          Thors appears briefly but his presence shapes the whole arc. His philosophy — that true warriors do not live by the sword — 
          is repeated and tested across Season 1. His words plant the idea of a life beyond violence in Thorfinn's heart.
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          “You don't have enemies. Do you want a sword, Thorfinn?” — Thors
        </blockquote>
        <p class="note">Although his screen time is short, Thors functions as the moral gravity that the narrative orbits around.</p>

        <h2>Thorfinn — Vengeance as Identity</h2>
        <p>
          By Season 1 Thorfinn's identity has been narrowed to a single purpose: revenge. The development here is psychological — the show shows 
          how an obsession with killing erodes empathy and shapes choices.
        </p>

          <li>Key fights that define him: (links below) Thorkell, Askeladd, various raids.</li>

      <div class="dev-text">
        <h2>Thorkell — The Test of Strength</h2>
        <p>
          The bridge duel with Thorkell is raw, chaotic and epic in choreography. It demonstrates Thorfinn’s tenacity and technique — and how 
          strength alone cannot answer the deeper moral questions the show raises.
        </p>

      <div class="dev-text">
        <h2>“I'm gonna kill you” — Rage Made Public</h2>
        <p>
          The scream is not only a battle cry: it is a statement of identity. We dissect its context — why it emerges, what it hides and how it isolates Thorfinn.
        </p>
        <p>
          Even while this cry marks the height of hatred, the scenes that follow show consequences — obedience to rage is obedience to emptiness.

      </div>

      <div class="dev-text">
        <h2>Askeladd — Manipulator, Mentor, Mirror</h2>
        <p>
          Askeladd is a strategist who uses his men and his image to survive and to shape events. His cruelty and cunning are tools — but he also speaks 
          truths that unsettle Thorfinn. He respects strength and exploits loyalty; he is both father-figure and obstacle.
        </p>
        <p class="callout">
          "Everyone is a slave to something." — use the scene of the rich man and the slave as visual proof of Askeladd's worldview.
        </p>
        <p>
          Askeladd’s relation with Canute and the assassination of the king are the pivot points that define political power and tragic consequences.

      <div class="dev-text">
        <h2>Trauma & The Price of Betrayal</h2>
        <p>
          Thorfinn’s guilt over the betrayal of the old woman and other violent acts becomes the seed of his later search for redemption. The series visualises how one act boomerangs into conscience.
