<!-- THORFINN SECTION -->

    <div class="char-text">
        <h2>Thorfinn Karlsefni</h2>
        <p>
            A child shaped by tragedy, a warrior forged in hate.  
            Thorfinn is the embodiment of lost innocence, carrying daggers that once belonged 
            to a man who rejected violence: his father, Thors.  
        </p>
        <p>
            His journey through Season 1 is a descent into brutality —  
            but beneath every act of violence lies the echo of his father's words:
            <span class="quote">“You have no enemies.”</span>
        </p>
        <p>
            His rivalry with Askeladd turns into a tragic bond.  
            He fights not for glory, but to fill the void left by his father’s death.
        </p>

<!-- ASKELADD SECTION -->

    <div class="char-media">

    <div class="char-text">
        <h2>Askeladd</h2>
        <p>
            A puppet master, a genius tactician, a man split between two worlds.  
            Askeladd is both villain and savior—  
            the murderer of Thors, yet the greatest teacher Thorfinn ever had.
        </p>
        <p>
            His philosophy becomes the backbone of Season 1:  
            <span class="quote">“Everyone is a slave to something.”</span>
        </p>
        <p>
            He manipulates kings, armies, and even fate itself.  
            His final act — murdering the king — fractures Thorfinn’s world forever.

<!-- THORS SECTION -->
<section class="character-section thors-section">
    <div class="char-media">
        <img src="./IMG/CHAR_gif/thors_hallway.gif" alt="Thors">
    </div>

    <div class="char-text">
        <h2>Thors</h2>
        <p>
            The strongest warrior of his time —  
            a man who chose peace over violence at the height of his power.
        </p>
        <p>
            His legacy shapes the entire season, especially Thorfinn’s inner conflict.  
            Thors is the moral foundation of the series, the voice that echoes long after his death.
        </p>
        <p>
            Through him we learn the thesis of the story:
            <span class="quote">“A true warrior needs no sword.”</span>
        </p>
    </div>
</section>


<!-- CANUTE SECTION -->
<section class="character-section canute-section">
    <div class="char-media">
        <img src="./IMG/CHAR_gif/canuto.webp" alt="Canute">
    </div>

    <div class="char-text">
        <h2>Prince Canute</h2>
        <p>
            A timid boy who becomes a messianic ruler.  
            His transformation is one of the most dramatic in the series.
        </p>
        <p>
            Guided by Ragnar’s love and scarred by his death,  
            Canute rises through grief to proclaim:
            <span class="quote">“I shall build a paradise on Earth.”</span>
        </p>
        <p>
            His bond with Askeladd is both political and spiritual —  
            and his ascension defines the climax of Season 1.
